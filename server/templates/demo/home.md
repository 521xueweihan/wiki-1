## Read the documentation

How do permissions work? How can I make my wiki publicly accessible?

It's all [in the docs](https://beta.js.wiki/docs/admin/groups)!

## Example Blocks

Did you know that you can insert dynamic [blocks](https://beta.js.wiki/docs/editor/blocks)?

For example, here are the 5 most recently updated pages on your wiki:

::block-index{orderBy="updatedAt" orderByDirection="desc" limit="5"}
::

This list will automatically update as you create / edit pages.
